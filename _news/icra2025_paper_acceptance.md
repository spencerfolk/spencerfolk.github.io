My paper titled "Towards Safe and Energy-Efficient Real-Time Motion Planning in Windy Urban Environments" was accepted for presentation at IEEE ICRA 2025 in Atlanta, GA! This paper is a follow-up to [my previous IEEE RAL paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10592305/), which will also be making an appearance.
