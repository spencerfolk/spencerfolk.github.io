I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am co-advised by [Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/) and [Mark Yim](https://www.modlabupenn.org/). Broadly speaking, my dissertation research studies how wind affects perception, planning, and control for UAVs operating in cluttered environments. Through my research, I strive to enable UAVs to reason about the complex wind patterns that arise in the urban canopy layer in real time using onboard sensing and compute, and to use this enhanced environmental awareness to operate safely, efficiently, and autonomously in future urban airspaces. My approach harnesses synergies between classical state estimation algorithms (e.g. Kalman filters), receding horizon optimal control, deep learning, rotary-wing aerodynamics, and fluid mechanics to proactively adjust flight trajectories with safety and energy efficiency in mind. 

Beyond my role as a Ph.D. candidate at GRASP, I also work with NASA as a Pathways intern on projects utilizing UAVs as mobile in-situ wind sensors. [These](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasa-armstrong-supports-wind-study/) [initiatives](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasa-concludes-wind-study/) aim to improve the accuracy and timeliness of urban weather forecasts, inform policy for future urban airspaces, and catalyze advancements in urban air mobility technologies. Prior to starting my Ph.D., my previous research for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory centered on designing 3D printed UAVs. 

Looking ahead, I aspire to one day develop algorithms for planetary UAV probes, empowering safe and efficient autonomous scientific exploration of our solar system's atmospheres.
