I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the [GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am co-advised by [Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/) and [Mark Yim](https://www.modlabupenn.org/). Broadly speaking, my dissertation research investigates how wind affects perception, motion planning, and control for UAVs operating in cluttered environments. Through my work, I strive to enable UAVs to reason about the complex wind patterns that arise in the urban canopy layer in real time using onboard sensing and compute, and to use this enhanced environmental awareness to operate safely, efficiently, and autonomously in future urban airspaces. 

In addition to my role at GRASP, I work with NASA as a Pathways intern on projects utilizing UAVs as mobile in-situ wind sensors. [These](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasa-armstrong-supports-wind-study/) [initiatives](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasa-concludes-wind-study/) aim to improve the accuracy and timeliness of urban weather forecasts, inform policy for future urban airspaces, and catalyze advancements in urban air mobility technologies. Before the Ph.D., I performed research for the U.S. Army Research Laboratory centered on the design and performance analysis of 3D printed UAVs. 

While my recent work is tailored towards urban air mobility, I'm passionate about all aspects of autonomous flight and its potential applications in society and beyond. On this website, you'll find a collection of my publications and a portfolio of a variety of engineering projects I've worked on over the years. Enjoy!
